Hi there, I'm Noxety! 👋
About Me
I’m a full-stack developer and freelance graphic designer, debugging life (and code) since 2018. I build scalable web apps, ERP & POS systems, and smooth UI/UX experiences — all powered by React, Laravel, Kotlin, and a dash of caffeine.

🌱 Currently trying to teach AI to do my job so I can focus on coffee breaks ☕

👯 Always open to collaborating on projects that make computers smarter and users happier

📫 Ping me at: thura3.shine33@gmail.com — I promise I don’t bite!

What I’ve Built
AI-powered POS & ERP systems for jewelry businesses (because even diamonds need digital sparkle)

Fitness tracking apps with Kotlin that count calories and steps — mostly for me to justify snacking

Marketing landing pages that look so good, they might just make you buy something you don’t need

Freelancer & client connect desktop apps in C# — connecting humans and machines, one bug at a time
